# 🌞 Solar Charging Using Sunlight

This project demonstrates a simple solar-powered charging system using a solar panel and a rechargeable battery.

## 🔋 Overview
Solar energy is harnessed using a panel and stored in a battery. This setup can power small electronics and is suitable for remote environments.

## ⚙️ Components Used
- 6V/12V Solar Panel
- Charge Controller Module (TP4056 or similar)
- 3.7V Li-ion Battery
- Blocking Diode
- Voltage Regulator (e.g., LM317)

## 🔧 How It Works
The solar panel converts sunlight into electricity, which charges the battery through the charge controller. Arduino can monitor battery levels using analog input.
